                    our own servers for this game. All online processing related to ads, analytics, consent, and

                    The Google Mobile Ads SDK may process: Advertising ID / App Set ID, IP address (for approximate
                    location), device/OS info, ad interactions, and technical logs and diagnostics (such as error codes
                    and performance data). Google may use this data for ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention;
                    some of this data is shared within the ads ecosystem. You can opt out of personalized ads via
                    consent and/or system settings.

                    Pseudonymous usage data (for example, screen views, session counts, and basic device information)
                    helps us understand how the game is used and improve gameplay and UX. Reports are generally viewed
                    in aggregate, not at the individual user level. We don't use Analytics features that link to ads
                    unless you've consented where required.

                    Crash reports and performance metrics (startup time, network reliability) help us find and fix
                    issues. These SDKs act as service providers processing data on our behalf. In regions where consent
                    is required (for example, the EEA/UK), Crashlytics and Firebase Performance are only enabled if
                    you've consented to analytics.
